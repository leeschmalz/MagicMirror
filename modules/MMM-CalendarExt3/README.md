## Concept

My previous module, `MMM-CalendarExt2`, was always notorious for its difficulty to use. I need a more easy and light one. So I rewrite this from scratch newly.

## Features

### What's different with `CX2`.

- Only focusing on how it shows; Parsing is delegated to original MagicMirror module `calendar`. (It means the `calendar` module is REQUIRED to use this module.)
- Only `week` and `month` views. I found that people are rarely interested in other views on `CX2`. So I drop out different views.
- Respect to original MM's hide/show mechanism. Now you can hide/show this module easily with other scheduler or control modules. (By the way, Look at this module also. - [MMM-Scenes](https://github.com/MMRIZE/MMM-Scenes))
- No dependency on the 3rd party modules (e.g. momentJS or Luxon, etc.). This is built with pure JS and CSS only.

### Main Features

- `week` view or `month` view
- locale-aware calendar
- customizing events: filtering, sorting, transforming
- multi-instance available. You don't need to copy and rename the module. Just add one more configuration in your `config.js`.

## Install

```sh
cd ~/MagicMirror/modules
git clone https://github.com/MMRIZE/MMM-CalendarExt3
```

## Config

Anyway, even this simplest will work.

```js
{
  module: "MMM-CalendarExt3",
  position: "bottom_center",
},

```

More conventional;

```js
{
  module: "MMM-CalendarExt3",
  position: "bottom_center",
  title: "",
  config: {
    mode: "month",
    instanceId: "basicCalendar",
    locale: 'de-DE',
    maxEventLines: 5,
    firstDayOfWeek: 1,
    calendarSet: ['us_holiday', 'abfall', 'mytest'],
    ...
  }
},
```

You need setup default `calendar` configuration also.

```js
/* default/calendar module configuration */
{
  module: "calendar",
  position: "top_left",
  config: {
    broadcastPastEvents: true, // <= IMPORTANT to see past events
    calendars: [
      {
        url: "webcal://www.calendarlabs.com/ical-calendar/ics/76/US_Holidays.ics",
        name: "us_holiday", // <= RECOMMENDED to assign name
        color: "red" // <= RECOMMENDED to assign color
      },
      ...

```

### Config details

All the properties are omittable, and if omitted, a default value will be applied.

| **property**           | **default**                          | **description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| `mode`                 | 'week'                               | Calendar view type. You can choose between 'week' and 'month'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `weekIndex`            | -1                                   | Which week starts in a view. `-1` is the previous week of the current focusing moment. `0` is the focusing week of the moment. `1` will be the next week, and so on.<br>Ignored on `mode:'month'`                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `weeksInView`          | 3                                    | How many weeks from the index. <br> `weekIndex:-1`, `weeksInView:3` means 3 weeks view from the last week. <br> Ignored on `mode:'month'`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `instanceId`           | (auto-generated)                     | When you want more than 1 instance of this module, each instance would need this value to distinguish each other. If you don't assign this property, the `identifier` of the module instance will be assigned automatically but not recommended to use it. (Hard to guess the auto-assigned value.)                                                                                 |
| `firstDayOfWeek`       | 1                                    | Monday is the first day of the week according to the international standard ISO 8601, but in the US, Canada, Japan and some cultures, it's counted as the second day of the week. If you want to start the week from Monday, set this property to `1`. If you want Sunday, set `0`. <br> Sunday:0, Monday:1, Tuesday:2, ..., Saturday:6                                             |
| `minimalDaysOfNewYear` | 4                                    | ISO 8601 also says **each week's year is the Gregorian year in which the Thursday falls**. The first week of the year, hence, always contains 4 January. However, the US (Yes, it is.) system differs from standards. In the US, **containing 1 January** defines the first week. In that case, set this value to `1`. And under some other culture, you might need to modify this. |
| `locale`               | (`language` of MM config)            | `de` or `ko-KR` or `ja-Jpan-JP-u-ca-japanese-hc-h12`. It defines how to handle and display your date-time values by the locale. When omitted, the default `language` config value of MM.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `calendarSet`          | []                                   | When you want to display only selected calendars, fulfil this array with the targeted calendar name(of the default `calendar` module). <br>e.g) `calendarSet: ['us_holiday', 'office'],`<br> `[]` or `null` will allow all the calendars.                                                                                                                                           |
| `maxEventLines`        | 5                                    | How many events will be displayed in 1-day cell. The overflowed events will be hidden.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `fontSize`             | '18px'                               | Default font size of this module.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `eventHeight`          | '22px'                               | The height of each event.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

## Notification

### Incoming Notifications

#### **(deprecated)** `CX3_MOVE_CALENDAR`, payload: {instanceId, step}

#### `CX3_GLANCE_CALENDAR`, payload: {instanceId, step}

Jump calendar view to another moment. It will return after `glanceTime` from last notification command.

- `instanceId` : If you have more than 1 instance of this module, you can specify the instance to manipulate. If omitted or `null`, all instances would obey this notification order.
- `step` : How many leaps of the current view. In `mode:'week'` 1 step will be a week. In `mode:'month'` 1 step will be a month. Negative value is allowed.

#### `CX3_SET_DATE`, payload: {instanceId, date}

Set the date of specific view.

- `instanceId` : See the above
- `date` : Specific date to move. e.g) In `mode:'month'`, `date: "2022-12-25"` would display calendar view of `2022 Decemeber`. Be aware of `weekIndex` of `mode:'week'`. The view range will be calculated with `weekIndex`, `weeksInView` and this value.

#### `CALENDAR_EVENTS`

Any module which can emit this notification could become the source of this module. Generally, the default `calendar` module would be.

#### `WEATHER_UPDATED`

Any module which can emit this notification could become the source of weather forecasting. Generally, the default `weather` module would be.

### Outgoing Notification

Nothing yet. (Does it need?)

## Styling with CSS

You can handle almost all of the visual things with CSS. See the `module.css` and override your needs into your `custom.css`.

- `CX3`, `CX3_{instanceId}`, `mode_week` or `mode_month` : The root selector. Each instance of this module will have `CX3_{instanceId}` as another root selector. With this CSS selector, you can assign individual look to each instance.

```css
.CX3 {
  /* you CAN modify these values; but SHOULD NOT to remove */
  --celllinecolor: #333;
  --cellbgcolor: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
  --cellheaderheight: 25px;
  --cellfooterheight: 2px;
  --defaultcolor: #fff;
  --eventheight: calc(var(--fontsize) + 4px);
  --totalheight: calc(var(--eventheight) * var(--maxeventlines));
  font-size: var(--fontsize);
  color: var(--defaultcolor);
  line-height: calc(var(--eventheight));
}
```

Most commonly used values would be defined in `.CX3` selector as variables.

`--fontsize`, `--maxeventlines`, `--eventheight` would be imported from configuration for your setup convenience.

- `.cell` : Every day cell has this selector. Each cell could have these class name together by its condition.
  - `.today`, `.thisMonth`, `.thisYear`
  - `.year_2022`, `.month_12`, `.date_25`, `.weekday_0`
- `.cellHeader`, `.cellFooter` : Parts of day cell. `.cellHeader` would have `.cw`(count of week) and `.cellDate` as children.

  - `.cellHeader .cellDate` : Displaying date of the cell. The date would have many parts of date/hour information from `cellDateOptions` of config.

- `.event` : Every event has this selector. Each event could have these class name together by its condition.
  - `.continueFromPreviousWeek`, `.continueToNextWeek`
  - `.calendar_{calendarName}`, `{class}` : Orginal `calendar`
  - `.passed`, `.future`, `.current`,
  - `.multiday`, `.singleday`, `.fullday`

And `event` also has `dataSet` (`data-*`) as its attributes. (e.g. data-title="...", data-start-date="...") You can use these attributes also.

- `.weekGrid`, `.weekGridRow` : Definition of calendar grid. You can adjust the grid itself. (e.g. Shrink the width of weekends cells)

## Handling Events

Each event object has this structure.

```json
{
  "title": "Leeds United - Chelsea",
  "startDate": 1650193200000,
  "endDate": 1650199500000,
  "fullDayEvent": false,
  "class": "PUBLIC",
  "location": false,
  "geo": false,
  "description": "...",
  "today": false,
  "symbol": ["calendar-alt"],
  "calendarName": "tottenham",
  "color": "gold",
  "calendarSeq": 1, // This would be the order from `calendarSet` of configuration
  "isPassed": true,
  "isCurrent": false,
  "isFuture": false,
  "isFullday": false,
  "isMultiday": false
}
```

You can use these values to handle events.

### Filtering

You can filter each event by its condition.

```js
eventFilter: (ev) => {
  if (ev.isFullday) return false;
  return true;
};
```

This example shows how you can filter out 'fullday' events.

### Sorting

You can sort each event by its condition. However, this module arranges events masonry with density. So displaying would not fit with your sorting intention. Anyway, try if you need it.

```js
eventSorter: (a, b) => {
  return a.calendarSeq - b.calendarSeq;
};
```

This example tries to sort events by calendar order in `calendarSet`.

### Transforming

You can manipulate or change the properties of the event.

```js
eventTransformer: (ev) => {
  if (ev.title.search("John") > -1) ev.color = "blue";
  return ev;
};
```

This example shows how you can transform the color of events when the event title has specific text.

## Fun things

### Weather forecast

When you are using MM's default `weather` forecasting, weather icon will be displayed on the day cell.

```js
useWeather: true,
weatherLocationName: 'New York',
// Original weather module might have its location name with more details. (e.g. 'New York City, US'), but the partial text included would be acceptable for this attribute.
// When the location name would not match, warning messgage will be shown on dev console. Check it.
```

### Font Awesome icons with brands

You can set `brands` icons like this; (However, default calendar module cannot accept FA brands icons AFAIK.)

```js
/* In your default calendar config */
symbol: ['fa-brands fa-canadian-maple-leaf'],
/* or */
symbol: ['brands canadian-maple-leaf'],
/* of course below are also allowed */
symbol: 'brands canadian-maple-leaf',
/* But if you want multi-icons, use array */
symbol: ['brands google-drive', 'solid calendar'],
```

### Compatible with `randomBrainstormer/MMM-GoogleCalendar`

```js
eventTransformer: (e) => {
  e.startDate = new Date(e.start?.date || e.start?.dateTime).valueOf();
  e.endDate = new Date(e.end?.date || e.end?.dateTime).valueOf();
  e.title = e.summary;
  e.fulldayEvent = e.start?.date ? true : false;
  return e;
};
```

## Not the bug, but...

- The default `calendar` module cannot emit the exact starting time of `multidays-fullday-event which is passing current moment`. Always it starts from today despite of original event starting time. So this module displays these kinds of multidays-fullday-event weirdly.
- I am not considering 5-weekdays-view at this moment. Only-Weekdays-view might be useful, but in some cultures/locales, Locale-aware `Weekdays` are not easy to normalize. Friday and Sunday are weekends in Brunei. Iran adopts Friday only. I cannot calculate any convenient way to normalize this kind of grid view.
- I'll add `TimeLine` and `TimeTable` views/extended modules in future.
